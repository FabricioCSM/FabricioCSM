  Welcome!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p>I'm Fabricio Martins, I'm a Web Developer with a degree in Mining Engineering, driven by challenges and the constant pursuit of self-improvement.</p>
  <hr>


My journey includes roles such as a temporary sales associate at clothing stores like Reserva in 2016/2017, volunteering at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, backpacking through South America and Europe in 2017/2023 respectively, among other adventures.

I am very fond of sports of all kinds and enjoy watching various games during the Summer and Winter Olympics. My favorite sports are soccer and handball; I trained in handball for six years and was selected for the Minas Gerais state team and pre-selection for the Brazilian national team.

I also have a strong interest in music, enjoying a variety of genres from classical to MPB, samba, and rock.

Finally, I emphasize my dedication to the active application of my knowledge. I aim to contribute significantly to the development and implementation of innovative solutions wherever I am.
